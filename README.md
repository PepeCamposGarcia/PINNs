This project is a direct implementation of 'Physics Informed Neural Networks', introduced by Raissi et al. ([2019](https://maziarraissi.github.io/PINNs/)). 

Three main different problems are discussed: Burgers equation with boundary and initial conditions, 2D time-independent Navier Stokes equations (lid driven cavity flow), and direct and indirect problems associated with the 2D time-dependent Navier Stokes equations.
